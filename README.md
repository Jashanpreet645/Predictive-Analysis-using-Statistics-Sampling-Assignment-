# Predictive-Analysis-using-Statistics-Sampling-Assignment

## 📌 Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning where the goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset.  
This project focuses on handling class imbalance using oversampling techniques, applying different sampling strategies, training multiple machine learning models, and comparing their performance.



## 🧠 Methodology
The project follows a systematic machine learning workflow:

**Data Collection ---> Dataset Balancing ---> Sampling ---> Model Training ---> Model Testing ---> Result Analysis**



## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Dataset Name:** `CreditCard_data.csv`
- **Target Column:** `Class`
- **Class Labels:**
  - `0` → Non-Fraudulent Transaction
  - `1` → Fraudulent Transaction

⚠️ The dataset is **highly imbalanced**, with fraudulent transactions forming a very small percentage of the total data.



## 🎯 Objectives
- Handle class imbalance using **oversampling techniques**
- Apply and evaluate **different sampling methods**
- Train multiple **machine learning models**
- Compare model performance using **accuracy**
- Analyze the impact of sampling on model performance



## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Imbalanced-learn
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook



## 🏗️ Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

*(Models may vary depending on experimentation)*



## 🧪 Evaluation Metric
- **Accuracy**
